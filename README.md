# Web-scraping using Splinter and HTML parsing with Beautiful Soup

Most of the source code was leveraged from the class activity file mars_news_solution.ipynb, however the chrome launch was not working. So the TA had the class run the devtools_solution.ipynb to enable selenium library. I had to change the syntax by googling it and using GPTchat. This assignement was a confusing assignment becasue the documentation is asking us to use Splinter when in class we had to use selenium. 
It was very helpful to have the starter code to see the outputs. I used the outputs to reverse figuring out the code. 

I commented out what I was doing for each task within jupyter notebook. please see the deliverable files of my comments within each task cell.
